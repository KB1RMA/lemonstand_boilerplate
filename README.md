# Lemonstand Boilerplate

Starting boilerplate (based on HTML5 Boilerpate) I use for creating new Lemonstand themes. Useful so I'm not building this basic layout each and every time I build a new theme.

## Quick Requirements

+ Under backdoor/cms/settings/config/ 'Enable file-based templates' must be set to on 
+ Path set to "{APP}/ls_templates". 
+ Content file extension" set to .php
